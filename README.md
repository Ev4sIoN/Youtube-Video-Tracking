# Youtube-Video-Tracking
This will track if a user Plays, Pauses or Finished a video. It will also record progress of the video that has been watched in increments of 25. So it will track 25%, 50% and 75% on top of the initial 3.

# Origin
This is not my original work, I have just modified it a bit from another source to work in the case I need. Such as adding the title as an available attribute for Analytics sake.
